Write a simple website where the user can enter a list of names separated by commas. The textfield entry & button to submit must be at the top of the page. 

The site must parse the entered list of names and for each name, display them in a list like fashion (every name must be a row in a table). The list must be displayed below the text field & submit button. 

Users can edit and delete names that are showing up in the list.

The code must focus on legibility and simplicity.

Write out a readme explaining how after downloading the code one can run it locally.

Site must be easily usable for both mobile & desktop devices.
